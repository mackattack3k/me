    section3:
      "Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.",
    section4:
      "I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\" Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot. We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before.",
    section5:
      'I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.'
